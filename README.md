# Front-end-project-for-Myntra
This project is a Myntra-style webpage built using HTML and CSS. It includes a navigation bar, category menus, profile icons, and multiple product sections displayed through locally stored images. The layout uses absolute positioning to recreate a shopping homepage interface for practice and UI design learning.
